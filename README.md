# Gmail Variation Generator

A simple, clean desktop tool that generates multiple Gmail address variations using dot and plus (`+`) tricks — all in a single click.

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

Using a trick that Gmail supports, you can turn **one Gmail address into thousands** — instantly!  
Each variation delivers to the **same inbox**, but can be used to register separate accounts on websites.

```
yourname@gmail.com
y.ourname@gmail.com
your.n.a.m.e+3@gmail.com
```

All of these will still reach **yourname@gmail.com**.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Download** the `.exe` from this repository.
2. **Run it** — no installation or Python required.
3. Enter your **Gmail address** (e.g., `yourname@gmail.com`).
4. Enter how many **variations** you'd like.
5. Click **Generate**, then choose **.txt** or **.csv** format.
6. Your generated emails will be saved as `emails.txt` or `emails.csv`.
